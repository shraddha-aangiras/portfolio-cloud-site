## üí° Key Features

<<<<<<< HEAD
- ‚úÖ **Real-time unique visitor tracking** using Firestore‚Äôs document-based reads and per-IP logic
- üß† **Smart counter logic**: visitors are counted only once per defined session/IP period (no blind increments!)
- üìä **Live usage analytics** integrated with frontend
- üåé **CDN-accelerated global delivery** with caching + cache-busting where necessary
- üõ†Ô∏è **Automated, multi-layer CI/CD pipelines** for backend, frontend, and infrastructure (Terraform deploys, bucket sync, API validation, Cypress tests)
- üîî **Multi-channel alerting** with uptime checks, email, Slack, and optional PagerDuty integration
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure observability dashboards** and monitoring policies as code
- üì¶ **Smoke-tested production deployments** using Cypress (ensures website and API sync and count rendering works)
- üîê **Fully secure backend APIs** served over HTTPS via API Gateway
- üß™ **Manual and automated testing** using Postman (manual) and Cypress (automated browser test)
- ‚ö° **Fully serverless**, autoscaling backend ‚Äî zero-maintenance and resilient
- üîÅ **Idempotent deployment** ‚Äî all infrastructure can be torn down and re-deployed with Terraform
- üå©Ô∏è **DevOps heavy lifting**: Load Balancers, IAM roles, Monitoring, SSL, API Gateway, DNS routing, all configured as code
=======
- ‚úÖ **Real-time unique visitor tracking** powered by a custom API built with Python and Flask, persisting data in Firestore
